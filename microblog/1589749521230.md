Yay layout is done! For now, anyway.

Explore my files - I've put a bunch of tips in comments.

Still working on Splat - I want to create classes that quickly theme stuff (e.g., splat-dark-triadic2-primary would be dark theme primarily triadic2 hue with primary hue accents). Also don't want to rely on a filter for changing the scheme, tho it may stay as a pure CSS option.
